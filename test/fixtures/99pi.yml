  description: "\n        <p>Juan de Oñate is one of the world’s lesser-known conquistadors,
    but his name can be found all over New Mexico. There are Oñate streets, Oñate
    schools, and, of course, Oñate statues. When an activist group removed one foot
    off an Oñate statue in 1998, they said it was a symbolic act meant to highlight
    the atrocities Oñate committed against the indigenous population.</p>\n\n<p>Just
    as people in New Mexico were learning more of this history, the city of Albuquerque
    was considering building yet another statue of him. This resulted in a years long
    conflict about how New Mexico should commemorate a “founding father” who committed
    such cruel acts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=27563&amp;post_type=episode\"

            <p>The year was 1982, and in the small city of Allentown on the eastern edge of Pennsylvania sat an AM radio station called WSAN. For years, it had broadcast country music to the surrounding Lehigh Valley -- an area known for malls, manufacturing and Mack Trucks.</p>

    <p>WSAN was about to undergo a complete identity change, from a country station and to a "nostalgia" station -- meaning Big Band, and soft hits from the 1950’s. They wanted a gimmick to hook new listeners, so WSAN decided to launch a good old-fashioned endurance contest, reminiscent of the pole sitting stunts or dance marathons popular in the 1920’s. They secured a local sponsor, Love Homes, to donate a prize: a single-wide modular home worth $18,000.</p>

    <p>It seemed like a simple marketing strategy, but WSAN had grossly underestimated just how much people would endure for a little economic security.</p>

            <p>In the spring of 1962, an ad man named Martin Speckter was thinking about advertising when he realized something: many ads asked questions, but not just any questions -- excited and exclamatory questions -- a trend not unique to his time. Got milk?! Where's the beef?! Can you hear me now?! So he asked himself: could there be a mark that made it clear (visually on a page) that something is both a question and an exclamation?!</p>

    <p>Speckter was also the editor of the typography magazine *TYPEtalks, *so  in March of 1962, in an article for the magazine titled “Making a New Point, Or How About That…”, Speckter proposed the first new mark of English language punctuation in 300 years: the interrobang.</p>

    <p>Plus, we revisit the story of another special character, the octothorpe.</p>

  description: "\n        <p>Until the early 90s, basketball uniforms were pretty
    tame. There had been real limits to what could be done with jerseys. All the details—the
    numbers, the names, the logos—had to be sewed on. Complicated graphics would have
    taken a massive amount of embroidery, which would have added additional weight
    and made the jersey hotter to wear. But dye sublimation changed everything. Sublimation
    is a process of printing dye directly into the fabric. Now for the first time,
    you could design something in Photoshop, and make it as big and colorful as you
    wanted. Then with sublimation, you could print that design straight onto the material
    without any embroidery or extra weight. This allowed NBA teams to go wild…and
    they did…which led to one of the most famous love-it-or-hate-it basketball jersey,
    the 1996 Toronto Raptors’ “Barney Uniform.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=25474&amp;post_type=episode\"

            <p>In the late 1920s, the Ford Motor Company bought up millions of acres of land in Brazil. They loaded boats with machinery and supplies, and shipped them deep into the Amazon rainforest. Workers cut down trees and cleared the land and then they built a rubber plantation in the middle of one of the wildest places on earth. But Henry Ford wanted this community -- called “Fordlândia” -- to be more than just a huge plantation. He envisioned an industrial utopia. He paid his Brazilian workers good wages, at least for the region. And he tried to build them the kind of place he would’ve loved to live, which is to say: a small Midwestern town...but in the middle of the jungle.</p>

            <p>In the 1970s it looked like the beloved, 200-year-old Cape Hatteras lighthouse was in danger. The sea was getting closer and threatening to swallow it up. And people were torn over what to do about it - they could move the lighthouse, or leave it in place and try to defend it against the forces of nature. For the next 30 years, the locals fought an intense political battle over this decision. It’s the kind of battle we can expect to see a lot more of as sea levels rise and threaten coastal communities around the world.</p>

            <p>It’s the end of the year and time for our annual Mini-stories episodes. Mini-stories are quick hit stories that were maybe pitched to us from someone in the audience, or something interesting we saw on twitter, or just a cool tidbit that we found in our research that stuck in our heads, but didn’t warrant a full episode for whatever reason. We’ll have stories of mysterious ice boats, green ruins, sack dresses, steampunk violins, and a little update from a couple of the notable city flags that have been redesigned around the country.</p>

            <p>When a new movie comes out, most of the praise goes to the director and the lead actors, but there are so many other people involved in a film, and a lot of them are designers.

It’s Annie Atkins’s job to design them.</p>

            <p>Monuments don’t just appear in the wake of someone’s death — they are erected for reasons specific to a time and place. In 1905, one such memorial was put up in downtown Memphis, Tennessee, to commemorate Nathan Bedford Forrest, who had died in 1877.<br><br>
    This week, we feature the story of an imagined plaque that could accompany this statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest.<br><br>
    Nate DiMeo originally produced this story for his show <a href="http://thememorypalace.us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Memory Palace</a> under the title: Notes on an Imagined Plaque to be Added to the Statue of General Nathan Bedford Forrest, Upon Hearing that the Memphis City Council has Voted to Move it and the Exhumed Remains of General Forrest and his Wife, Mary Ann Montgomery Forrest, from their Current Location in a Park Downtown, to the Nearby Elmwood Cemetery.</p>

    ten times bigger, spanning roughly 2,000 square miles of Virginia and North Carolina.<br><br>\nAnd
    it’s understandable why people called the swamp “dismal.” Temperatures can reach
    over 100 degrees. It’s humid and soggy, filled with thorns and thickets, teeming
    with all sorts of dangerous and unpleasant wildlife. The panthers that used to

    and swarms of yellow flies and mosquitoes.<br><br>\nHundreds of years ago, before
    the Civil War, the dangers of the swamp and its seeming impenetrability actually
    attracted people to it. The land was so untamed that horses and boats couldn’t
    enter, and the colonists who were filing into the region detested it. William
    Byrd II, a Virginia planter, called it “a miserable morass where nothing can inhabit.”
    But people did inhabit the swamp, including thousands of enslaved Africans and
    African Americans who escaped their captors and formed communities in the swamp.

    <title>Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard</title>
    <generator>https://simplecast.com</generator>
    <description>Hi, I’m Dax Shepard, and I love talking to people. I am endlessly fascinated by the messiness of being human, and I find people who are vulnerable and honest about their struggles and shortcomings to be incredibly sexy. I invite you to join me as I explore other people’s stories. We will celebrate, above all, the challenges and setbacks that ultimately lead to growth and betterment. What qualifies me for such an endeavor? More than a decade of sobriety, a degree in Anthropology and four years of improv training. I will attempt to discover human “truths” without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection. I will be, in the great tradition of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">e78eb39e-87ab-47c1-ade2-edc739c9ea4b</guid>
      <description>In this episode of Experts on Expert, the Armchair Expert speaks to author, professor and Israeli historian, Yuval Noah Harari. In this far too brief episode, Yuval discusses the differences between our experiential and narrative selves, he talks about a not so distant future in which AI will drastically alter the workforce and he theorizes on why the technological evolution could potentially warrant the return of communism. The two discuss the idea of myths, virtual reality and security. Dax and Monica mourn the fact that they only had an hour with Yuval and Dax takes an armcherry song request in the fact check. 

Yuval Noah Harari is a tenured professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is the author of the international bestsellers Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.

      <description>Van Hunt is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and one of Dax’s longtime obsessions.

Van explains his acceptance of never fitting into a box and Dax practically croaks as Van sings live for the podcast. Monica and Dax debate a controversial topic during the fact check and yet they still like each other at the end of it.  Thus, proving the impossible- respectful disagreement can exist!

      <title>Introducing: Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard </title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">8b2fd85f-7199-46ef-9be5-8f91b096dc19</guid>
      <description>Hi, I’m Dax Shepard, and I love talking to people. I am endlessly fascinated by the messiness of being human, and I find people who are vulnerable and honest about their struggles and shortcomings to be incredibly sexy. I invite you to join me as I explore other people’s stories. We will celebrate, above all, the challenges and setbacks that ultimately lead to growth and betterment.

What qualifies me for such an endeavor? More than a decade of sobriety, a degree in Anthropology and four years of improv training. I will attempt to discover human “truths” without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection. I will be, in the great tradition of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.

generator: https://simplecast.com
description: Hi, I’m Dax Shepard, and I love talking to people. I am endlessly fascinated
  by the messiness of being human, and I find people who are vulnerable and honest
  about their struggles and shortcomings to be incredibly sexy. I invite you to join
  me as I explore other people’s stories. We will celebrate, above all, the challenges
  and setbacks that ultimately lead to growth and betterment. What qualifies me for
  such an endeavor? More than a decade of sobriety, a degree in Anthropology and four
  years of improv training. I will attempt to discover human “truths” without any
  laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection. I will be, in the great tradition
  of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.

    Hi, I’m Dax Shepard, and I love talking to people. I am endlessly fascinated by the messiness of being human, and I find people who are vulnerable and honest about their struggles and shortcomings to be incredibly sexy. I invite you to join me as I explore other people’s stories. We will celebrate, above all, the challenges and setbacks that ultimately lead to growth and betterment.

    What qualifies me for such an endeavor? More than a decade of sobriety, a degree in Anthropology and four years of improv training. I will attempt to discover human “truths” without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection. I will be, in the great tradition of 16th-century scientists, an Armchair Expert.
